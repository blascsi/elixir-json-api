# JsonAPI

This is a learning repository, dedicated for working through the excellent [tutorial](https://lobotuerto.com/blog/building-a-json-api-in-elixir-with-phoenix/) of [Victor Adrian](https://lobotuerto.com/).

It contains a simple JSON endpoint written in Elixir with the help of the Phoenix framework.

## Usage

Be sure to have Elixir and Postgresql installed on your system. 
The credentials for the development database can be set in `config/dev.exs`.

* Pull the code from the repository
* Run `mix setup` inside the project folder
* Run `mix phx.server`
* You have your server running on port 4000!
